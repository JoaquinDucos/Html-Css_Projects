**Simple web pages created for Harvard Course/University Projects.**

Made from scratch a look_alike Wikipedia with some of their main functionalities.
Made another 'look-alike' web page, based on the Google Motor search page.
Made a functional web about Blockchain and Cloud services. (Topics that I'm interested)
